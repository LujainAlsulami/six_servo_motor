# six_servo_motor

This repository includes controlling six servo motors using six potentiometers with an Arduino board. Each potentiometer corresponds to its servo motor.


Step one:


Servo Motors Connections:

1-The power wires of all servo motors to the 5V in the Arduino board. 

2-The ground wires of all servo motors to the GND in the Arduino board. 

3-The signal wire of each servo motor to pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 in the Arduino board. 


Potentiometers Connections:

1-The right of each potentiometer to the 5V in the Arduino board. 

2-The left of each potentiometer to the GND pin in the Arduino board. 

3-The middle pin of each potentiometer to the pins A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 on the Arduino board. 


Step two:

Write the code to change each servo motor position.

Output:
